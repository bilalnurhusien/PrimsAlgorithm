    Description:
    Prim's minimum spanning tree algorithm was used to compute the overall cost
    of a minimum spanning tree.
    
    Input File:
    The input file contains an adjacency list representation of an undirected
    weighted graph with vertices and edge weights. For example, an entry of
    "6 	141,8200" indicates that there is an edge between vertex 6 and vertex
    141 with weight 8200.
    
    Output:
    The cost of the minimum spanning tree will be displayed in standard output.
